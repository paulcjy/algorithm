## 문제

[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/6182)


<p>Farmer John's cows have taken an interest in exploring the territory around the farm. Initially, all N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1,000,000,000) cows commence traveling down a road in one big group. Upon encountering a fork in the road, the group sometimes chooses to break into two smaller (nonempty) groups with each group continuing down one of the roads. &nbsp;When one of those groups arrives at another fork, it might split again, and so on.</p>

<p>The cows have crafted a peculiar way of splitting: if they can split into two groups such that the sizes of the groups differ by exactly K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 1000), then they will split in that way; otherwise, they stop exploring and just start grazing peacefully.</p>

<p>Assuming that there will always be new forks in the road, compute the final number of groups of peacefully grazing cows.</p>



## 입력


<p>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K</p>



## 출력


<ul>
<li>Line 1: A single integer representing the number of groups of grazing cows</li>
</ul>
